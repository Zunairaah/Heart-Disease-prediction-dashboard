**Heart Disease Prediction Web App Dashboard**  

**Overview**  
This project is a web-based interactive dashboard built using **Plotly Dash**. The app focuses on visualizing heart disease-related data and predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs. It provides an intuitive interface for both data exploration and predictive analysis, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in healthcare.

**Features**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Home Page**  
- Provides a brief introduction and overview of the app.  
- Explains the purpose and functionality of the dashboard.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Dataset Page**  
- Displays the dataset in a tabular format.  
- Allows users to view the dataset in chunks of 20 rows per page.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Categorical Data Visualization**  
- Visual representation of categorical features from the dataset.  
- Includes bar charts, pie charts, and other relevant plots for better understanding.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Numerical Data Visualization**  
- Visualizes numerical columns using various types of plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.  
- Helps identify trends and patterns in the data.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Prediction Page**  
- Integrates a machine learning model (KNN algorithm) for heart disease prediction.  
- Takes user inputs for each feature in the dataset.  
- Predicts whether the user is at risk of heart disease and displays the result.  

**Technology Stack**  
- **Frontend**: Plotly Dash for interactive UI.  
- **Backend**: Python for data handling and model training.  
- **Machine Learning**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for prediction.  
- **Visualization**: Plotly for creating dynamic and interactive charts and graphs.  

**Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project contains medical features relevant to heart disease prediction. It includes a mix of categorical and numerical columns.  
**Future Improvements**  
- Adding support for multiple machine learning models.  
- Enhancing the UI for better user experience.  
- Adding more detailed performance metrics for the prediction model.
